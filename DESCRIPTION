Description: An R-package for spatial and temporal analysis of floodplain 
    inundation characteristics and application of habitat suitability criteria.
    It takes as input raster data of depth and velocity (e.g., from 2D 
    hydrodynamic modeling) at known flows and a corresponding daily flow time 
    series. Daily rasters of estimated depth and velocity are generated from 
    inputs using spatially resolved piece-wise linear interpolation. 
    Hydrospatial analysis functions calculate a range of physical metrics using
    the raster time series. Habitat suitability criteria applied to the 
    computed physical metrics estimate spatially resolved daily cell suitability,
    allowing for computation of daily weighted usable area. Statistical and 
    graphical summary of these metrics in space and time.
