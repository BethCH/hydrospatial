# hydrospatial
An R-package for spatial and temporal analysis of floodplain inundation characteristics and habitat suitability from raster data

## Installation
Installing the `hydrospatial` requires `devtools`. To install `hydrospatial`:

```r 
devtools::install_github("sfei/hydrospatial")
```

This will install dependencies, if necessary: `raster`, `igraph`, `doParallel`.

Note that this package is in development and should be checked regularly for updates.

## Implementation of the hydrospatial package

This package is currently being used as part of the Central Valley Habitat Exchange's Chinook salmon Habitat Quantification Tool (HQT).
