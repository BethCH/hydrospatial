\title{Function for hydrospatial analysis of inundation duration}
\usage{
hsa_duration(rs_i, fdf_e, igrp, wy, outdir)
}
\arguments{
\item{rs_i}{Raster stack or brick with inundated cells = 1}

\item{fdf_e}{Flood events data frame for water year in format of 'utils_hsaflwsevts'
function}

\item{igrp}{Vector of grouped floods days of length equal to number of rs_i layers,
where each unique value is a unique flood event}

\item{wy}{Water year to add to filenames}

\item{outdir}{Directory for writing rasters to file}
}
\value{
Flood events data frame for water year with duration metrics filled in.
Writes the duration rasters to file in the outdir.
}
\description{
This function accepts
}
\details{
Input rasters are in the 'rsi' format of output from the hsa_extent function,
where cells = 1 are inundated and non-inundated cells = NA. Rasters are written to
file in a 'rsdur0' directory within 'outdir'.
}
